- Best Filterstrategy so far:
	- Only keep active users (> 4 ratings)
	- Do not filter further
		- For testing purposes random sampling works equally well
	- Filter by IQR: [-0.5 3.5] does not work properly

- Train-test-split:
	- Time-dependent development seems to be not present overall as algorithms perform equally
	  well independent of the used split
	- Last ratings user split seems to be a very resonable one

- Sampling
